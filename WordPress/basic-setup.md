# Setup and Installation of WordPress and Boilerplate

*   All new WordPress themes will be based on the current version of the Inverse Paradox boilerplate theme.

*   When installing WordPress plugins, the list of commonly used / preferred plugins will be first consulted and an appropriate plugin from that list will be installed, if one exists.
    
*	All content of a theme, aside from design elements, will be editable by the client from the WordPress backend.

    *   Site-wide options (headers, footers) will be in the theme options page (created with ACF)
	
    *   Page-specific options will be custom fields on the relevant page (created with ACF)
	
    *   Sidebars will be populated with widgets, where reasonable.
	
    *   Rotating banners will be created with the ACF repeater fields plugin.
	
*   The WordPress core and all plugins will be kept up-to-date during development.
