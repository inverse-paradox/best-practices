# Files on the Websites Drive

*   The folder name will be the same as the company’s name in the client database, in upper camel case with no spaces (e.g.: InverseParadox)

*   The root project folder will mirror the site’s public_html or equivalent directory

*   Directories on the websites drive not intended to be uploaded will be prefixed with “_” and given an intuitive name.
    
	*   *e.g., the original static html files that were later converted to a WordPress theme might be found in a folder called “_original”.*

*   When working on a site, local files will be edited and uploaded; files on the server will not be edited directly.
