# Browser Support

*   All sites will be tested in current versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari (on both Mac and Windows), IE9; and IE8.
*   IE6 is no longer supported.
*   IE7 is partially supported: site must be usable in IE7 but does not necessarily have to look the same.
*   Minor aesthetic variations (e.g. rounded corners) are allowable in older browsers.
