# HTML Tags and Structure

*   HTML5 doctype will be used

*   New HTML5 tags (footer, section, etc.) will not be used, as the standards for their use are not clear

*   Aria Roles will be used to define the basic content parts of a site

*   H1 tags will be used for the logo on the homepage only; on all other pages, H1 tags will be used for the page title.  
    *TBD - tag to use for logo on interior pages*
